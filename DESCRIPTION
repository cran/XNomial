Description: Tests whether a set of counts fit a given expected ratio. For
    example, a genetic cross might be expected to produce four types in the
    relative frequencies of 9:3:3:1. To see whether a set of observed counts
    fits this expectation, one can examine all possible outcomes with xmulti() or a
    random sample of them with xmonte() and find the probability of an observation
    deviating from the expectation by at least as much as the observed. As a
    measure of deviation from the expected, one can use the log-likelihood
    ratio, the multinomial probability, or the classic chi-square statistic. A
    histogram of the test statistic can also be plotted and compared with the
    asymptotic curve.
